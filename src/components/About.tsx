                Hello! I'm <strong>Armin</strong>, a full-stack developer with
                over three years of professional experience in building and
                scaling web applications. My background spans both backend and
                frontend ‚Äî from reliable APIs in
                <strong> Python</strong> and <strong>Ruby on Rails</strong> to
                modern interfaces in
                <strong> React</strong> and <strong>TypeScript</strong>.
              </p>

              <p className="leading-relaxed mb-6">
                I‚Äôve worked on SaaS platforms, AI-driven recruitment systems,
                and large-scale design tools used by engineers and business
                teams. My focus is on clean, maintainable code, scalable
                architecture, and delivering features that truly impact users. I
                enjoy combining data-driven logic with intuitive UI design to
                create complete, high-quality products.
              </p>

              <p className="leading-relaxed">
                Outside of coding, I like exploring new technologies,
                contributing to open-source projects, and learning about AI
                automation. I value teamwork, knowledge sharing, and continuous
                improvement ‚Äî both in code and in life.
